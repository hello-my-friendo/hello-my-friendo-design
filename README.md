# Hello, My Friendo! - Design

## Features

### Wants

Hello, My Friendo! allows users to create a `Want`, which is something that the user wants to do. Examples:

* Play a Board Game
* Eat Pizza
* Get a Haircut

The user can select who will see the `Want`:

* Specific Users
* Groups
* Friends
* Public

And can also select in what radius of some location people will see it (example, people in a 10km radius from a location the user chooses).

If an user is interested in a `Want`, he can join.

Users can chat inside a `Want`.

The `Want` has Administrators. Administrators can:

* Confirm joining members, when the `Want` is public.
* Remove members.
* Create `Events`.
* Approve `Events` created by members. 
* Give other members the Administrator role.

### Events

`Want` members can create `Events`

### Promote

Users can promote their `Wants`, for example:

* Pizza Promotion
* Haircut Promotion

Promotions are displayed in a featured way, and the platform matches the promotions to people who wish to get them.

### Market Reports

The app can make reports available to users looking to understand their target markets.

### Selling

Users can create products to sell in the platform. The platform charges a fee when that happens.
